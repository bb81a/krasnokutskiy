In this post I want to tell you about my workplace and the accessories I use while working. For this reason, I leave the links and resources that make up my desktop. So here you go!

For the record, I currently work as a mobile QA engineer. I spend a lot of hours on the computer, testing, improving the project you're reading this post on, and learning new things. So I put together a desk that allows me to be productive in these areas.

## The Desk

Creating an efficient workspace is critical to productivity. I had the honor of testing [VANDBORG table](https://jysk.ua/ofis/stil-kompyuterniy/stil-pysmovyy-vandborg-60kh120-dub/chorn), which is as convenient as possible. Moreover, its aesthetics match its functionality.

## Monitors and Lighting

A high-quality monitor is a must for my work, and I've chosen the LG 34WN780. Its ergonomic stand offers complete control over screen positioning, allowing me to customize my view. Additionally, I've incorporated the BenQ Screen Bar Halo, a USB-powered lamp that provides consistent and glare-free illumination for my workspace.

## Computer Setup

My primary workhorse is the 16-inch MacBook Pro, a reliable and powerful companion. To streamline my connections and reduce cable clutter, I use an Anker USB-C hub. This setup allows me to focus on my work without distractions. For a superb audio experience, I turn to the AirPods Max, which provide exceptional sound quality and help me maintain my productivity.
